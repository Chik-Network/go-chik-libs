# Config Package

Locates and parses a chik configuration file into a config struct. If the `CHIK_ROOT` environment variable is set, the config will be loaded from that location. Otherwise, the package will look in `~/.chik/mainnet`. [See the wiki for for more information on using the `CHIK_ROOT` variable.](https://github.com/Chik-Network/chik-blockchain/wiki/INSTALL#testnets)
